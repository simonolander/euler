abstract={The Netherlands Forensic Institute and the Institute for Forensic Science in Shanghai are in search of a signature verification system that can be implemented in forensic casework and research to objectify results. We want to bridge the gap between recent technological developments and forensic casework. In collaboration with the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence we have organized a signature verification competition on datasets with two scripts (Dutch and Chinese) in which we asked to compare questioned signatures against a set of reference signatures. We have received 12 systems from 5 institutes and performed experiments on online and offline Dutch and Chinese signatures. For evaluation, we applied methods used by Forensic Handwriting Examiners (FHEs) to assess the value of the evidence, i.e., we took the likelihood ratios more into account than in previous competitions. The data set was quite challenging and the results are very interesting.},

title={Hidden Markov model estimation based on alpha-EM algorithm: Discrete and continuous alpha-HMMs},
year={2011},
pages={808--816},
abstract={Fast estimation algorithms for Hidden Markov models (HMMs) for given data are presented. These algorithms start from the alpha-EM algorithm which includes the traditional log-EM as its proper subset. Since existing or traditional HMMs are the outcome of the log-EM, it had been expected that the alpha-HMM would exist. In this paper, it is shown that this foresight is true by using methods of the iteration index shift and likelihood ratio expansion. In each iteration, new update equations utilize one-step past terms which are computed and stored during the previous maximization step. Therefore, iteration speedup directly appears as that of CPU time. Since the new method is theoretically based on the alpha-EM, all of its properties are inherited. There are eight types of alpha-HMMs derived. They are discrete, continuous, semi-continuous and discrete-continuous alpha-HMMs, and both for single and multiple sequences. Using the properties of the alpha-EM algorithm, the speedup property is theoretically analyzed. Experimental results including real world data are given.},

Applications to date are reviewed. Increasing use of the algorithm in a widening variety of areas is foreseen.},

  abstract={Signatures have been used to authenticate documents and transactions for over 1500 years and are still being used today. In this project a method for verifying signatures written on a tablet has been developed and tested in order to test whether pressure information is vital for a well performing on-line signature verification systems. First a background study was conducted to learn about the state-of-the-art methods and what features several research systems used, then the method was developed. The method is a Dynamic Time Warp with 8 local features, 2 of them were pressure values or derived from pressure, and 1 global feature. The developed method was tested on SUSig visual corpus containing signatures from 94 persons. The Equal Error Rate (EER) when not using pressure was 5.39 % for random forgeries and 3.24 % for skilled forgeries. EER when using pressure was 5.19 % for random forgeries and 2.80 % for skilled forgeries. The background study concluded that pen inclination is not required for a well performing system. Considering the result of this project and the result of others, it seems that pressure information is not vital, but provide some valuable information that can be used to classify signatures more accurately.}
